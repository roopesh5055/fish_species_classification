# Fish Species Classification Model
This repository contains a ML web app for predicting fish species based on the Fish Market dataset. The dataset comprises various parameters such as weight, length, height, and width, which are utilized to classify the fish species.

## Approach
A classification approach was chosen to predict the fish species. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected as the model due to its effectiveness in handling multi-class classification problems.

## Implementation
- The model was developed using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
- The frontend of the application was built using HTML/CSS to provide a user-friendly interface for input.
- Flask was employed to create the backend server, facilitating communication between the frontend and the model.
- The application is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed through the link: https://fish-species-c-4cdab016265a.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions for Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
- Run the Flask application using python app.py.
- Access the application through your web browser.
